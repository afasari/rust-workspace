# Rust Todo API

A simple RESTful API for managing todos built with Rust, Axum, and Diesel.

## Features

- CRUD operations for todos
- PostgreSQL database
- RESTful API endpoints
- Docker support
  
## Prerequisites

- Rust
- PostgreSQL
- Diesel CLI

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the database URL
3. Run migrations:

    ```bash
    diesel migration run
    ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## Usage

The API is available at `The API is available at URL_ADDRESS:8081`.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /tasks` - Create a new task
- `GET /tasks` - List all tasks
- `GET /tasks/{id}` - Get a specific task
- `POST /tasks/{id}` - Update a task
